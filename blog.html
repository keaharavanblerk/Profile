            <p> Hi, I am Keahara van Blerk. I am a intern at mlab codetribe , I am a web developer.<br /> I studied IT
                before
                but dont really have any experience in it.<br /> Since I have joined mlab I gained alot of experience in
                coding and programming. I created a website for Mandela Day.<br /> This was my first big project that I
                worked
                on,it was very exciting. We had to do something for mandela day so we created websites for non profit
                organisations and the webiste me and my partner did was ROTO it was for a disability center.<br /> Going
                into
                the technical field I never thought that I would make it but I actually love it , the work is very
                interesting and I learn new things everyday.<br /> I have work experince in customer services, I worked
                as a
                cashier at a bottle store wasnt the best experince that I had but it was life changing I came out a
                better
                person from the exoperince that I had there.<br /> I also worked at a call center the experince I got
                from
                that was experience but unfortunatley due to covid 19 we lost our jobs.<br /> I am grateful for the job
                that I
                have now , the way my focus and my thinking has changed makes everything worth it.<br /> I would like to
                continue my studying and even open a business one day.<br /> Some days its hard to go on but I keep
                pushing.
            </p>
